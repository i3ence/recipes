310g tofu (coop)
4 cloves of garlic
30ml kikkoman
20ml rice vinegar
tofu soaked it all up :D
add 1.5tbsp cornstarch

sauce:
2tsp conrnstarch
20ml water
10ml soy
10ml rice vin


simpol version:
1 pack firm tofu diced (500g?)
1 cup cornstarch
salt
oil for frying

1/4 tbsp soy sauce -> 15ml instead
4 cloves garlic
1/4 tbsp water -> 30ml instead (2tbsp)
1/4 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp sesame oil -> 1 tsp instead
1 tbsp ginger grated
-> extra: 10ml vinegar -> tone it down to 5ml, quite tasteable
- > boil until syrupy

added also 1 tsp cornstarch + 1 tbsp water slurry -> bit too soggy as done, but half of it could work as a stabilizer, and it has a nice katsudon-like texture

adjsuted for coop:
keep all sauce stuff the same, sut use 1 coop pack isntead of what's probably 500g tofu ;)

fry 1 pack (310g) at a time with 2 tablespoon cornstarch coating
add to oily pan after starching, sprinkle with some salt
cook until light brown

tofu prep for 310g tofu:
- coat tofu in 2tbsp cornstarch, add 1 tsp salt
- fry tofu
- add sauce below, + cornstarch slurry (1tsp water, 1tsp cornstarch)
- cook until thickened
